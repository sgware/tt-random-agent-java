/**
 * A Tandem Tales agent that makes random choices. This agent can play as either
 * role, in any story world, and with any partner.
 * <p>
 * This agent follows a simple process when making its choices. When choosing a
 * turn, the agent has a {@link #PASS_PROBABILITY} chance to pass control to its
 * partner. If it does not pass, it chooses a non-pass action uniformly at
 * random. There is one exception to this rule. When this agent has to decide on
 * a join action proposed by its partner, it has a {@link SUCCEED_PROBABILITY}
 * chance of letting the action succeed.
 * <p>
 * This agent waits a random number of milliseconds up to {@link #delay} to give
 * the impression that it is thinking. If the delay is set to 0, the agent will
 * take turns with no delay.
