# Tandem Tales Random Agent (Java)

This repository provides a simple example of how to create a
[Tandem Tales](https:sgware.github.io/tt) agent in Java that makes random
decisions according to this policy:

- If this is a normal turn, the agent chooses to `PASS` control to its partner
  30% of the time. If not passing, it chooses a non-`PASS` action uniformly at
  random.
- If this is a `SUCCEED`/`FAIL` decision, the agent chooses `SUCCEED` 80% of the
  time.

This repository exists to be forked by anyone developing their own Java agent.

The [Docker image](Dockerfile) in this project defines a
[container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) (basically a
lightweight virtual machine) that has the
[Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/), the
[Tandem Tales Java library](https://github.com/sgware/tt-server), and
[the code for this agent](root/app/src/tt) already installed. Docker makes it
easy to package your agent so others can easily run it without worrying about
dependencies, versions numbers, etc.

The [Docker Compose configuration](compose.yaml) makes it easy to run your agent
alongside a local instance of the
[Tandem Tales Web Server](https://github.com/sgware/tt-web) so your agent has
something to connect to and so you can test your agent in a web browser. Docker
Compose handles generating the self-signed SSL certificates, the network
configuration, setting up the Tandem Tales database, and running the web server
for you so you can focus on developing your agent.

## Download, Build, and Run

To download and run this agent, you need [Git](http://git-scm.com),
[Docker](http://www.docker.com), and
[Docker Compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose) installed. You *don't* need
Java or any libraries installed, because all of that is already in the Docker
image.

To download and run this agent alongside a local instance of the Tandem Tales
web server, open a console and type:
```
git clone https://github.com/sgware/tt-random-agent-java.git
cd tt-random-agent-java
docker compose build
docker compose up
```
Then open a web browser and go to [http://localhost](http://localhost) to see a
local version of the Tandem Tales website running on your computer where you can
play an interactive story with this agent.

## Make This Agent Your Own

### Name and Settings

The first thing you should do to customize this agent is to change its name.
Find the main agent constructor in
[`RandomAgent.java`](root/app/src/tt/RandomAgent.java):
```
private RandomAgent(String url, int port, Random random, long delay) {
    super("random", null, null, null, url, port);
    ...
}
```
Change the string `"random"` to your agent's new name.

You also need to set this new name name in the environment variable file
[`.env`](.env). Change the line that looks like this:
```
name="random"
```
You should also change the `title` and `description` variables to something that
better fit your new agent.

Now stop the container (`ctrl+C` in the terminal, or use the stop button in the
GUI). Rebuild your image and start it back up with one line:
```
docker compose up --build
```
Go to [https://localhost/play](https://localhost/play) to see your new agent's
title and description on the list of available agents.

This random agent can play in any story world in either role (player or game
master). Most agents aren't that flexible. Suppose your agent is only designed
to play in the `tutorial` world and only in the `GAME_MASTER` role. You'll need
to change your agent constructor to look something like this:
```
private RandomAgent(String url, int port, Random random, long delay) {
    super("barista", "tutorial", Role.GAME_MASTER, null, url, port);
    ...
}
```
And don't forget to change the [`.env`](.env) file to match:
```
name="barista"
title="The Barista"
description="This agent plays as the barista in the tutorial."
world="tutorial"
role="GAME_MASTER"
```

### Agent Code

Now it's time to start changing the code. The random agent is pretty simple. In
fact, it's [just three files](root/app/src/tt)!

The only method a Tandem Tales
[client](https://sgware.github.io/tt-server/edu/uky/cs/nil/tt/Client.html)
*needs* to implements is
[`onChoice(Status)`](https://sgware.github.io/tt-server/edu/uky/cs/nil/tt/Client.html#onChoice(edu.uky.cs.nil.tt.world.Status)).
Every time it is your agent's turn in the story, this method gets called. The
`status` object has
[a ton of useful information](https://sgware.github.io/tt-server/edu/uky/cs/nil/tt/world/Status.html)
in it, including:
- `status.getHistory()` has all the turns that have happened so far in the
  story.
- `status.getState()` tells you the current value of all the world's
  variables.
- `status.getDescriptions()` has natural language descriptions of all the
  objects your agent can currently see.
- `status.getChoices()` is a list of the things you can do next.

The `onChoice(Status)` method should return the integer index (starting at 0) of
the choice from `status.getChoices()` that you want to make.

Change the `onChoice(Status)` method to print the `world` and `status` objects
to file so you can see all the useful information in them. First, at the top of
the file, add this:
```
import java.io.*;
import com.google.gson.*;
```
Then change `onChoice(Status)` to look like this:
```
@Override
protected int onChoice(Status status) {
    GsonBuilder builder = new GsonBuilder();
    Message.configure(builder);
    Gson gson = builder.setPrettyPrinting().create();
    try(FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("world.json")) {
        gson.toJson(getWorld(), writer);
    }
    catch(IOException exception) {
        exception.printStackTrace();
    }
    try(FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("status.json")) {
        gson.toJson(status, writer);
    }
    catch(IOException exception) {
        exception.printStackTrace();
    }
    ...
}
```

Now take a look at
[`RandomAgentFactory.java](root/app/src/tt/RandomAgentFactory.java). An agent
only plays one story session and then closes. If you want to be able to play
with your agent more than once, you need a factory that makes new agents on
demand.

Good news! Almost all of that code is already written for you. All you have to
do is extend
[`edu.uky.cs.nil.tt.ClientFactory`](https://sgware.github.io/tt-server/edu/uky/cs/nil/tt/ClientFactory.html)
and implement the
[`create()`](https://sgware.github.io/tt-server/edu/uky/cs/nil/tt/ClientFactory.html#create())
method like this:
```
@Override
protected RandomAgent create() {
    return new RandomAgent(url, port);
}
```

In the `main(String[])` method of
[`RandomAgentMain.java`](root/app/src/tt/RandomAgentMain.java), you'll see the
code that makes a new factory and runs it:
```
try(RandomAgentFactory factory = new RandomAgentFactory(url, port)) {
    factory.call();
}
```

A factory starts by making one agent. That agent waits on the server for a
partner to play with. As soon as it finds a partner, the factory will make a new
agent to take the old agent's place waiting on the server. That way, you never
run out of agents to play with.

By the way, you might want to change the names of the `RandomAgent`,
`RandomAgentFactory`, and `RandomAgentMain` classes to something that better
fits your agent.

### Agent Lifecycle Methods

The only methods you *need* to implement are `onChoice(Status)` in your agent
and `create()` in your factory. But there's a bunch of other methods that get
called at important moments in the agent's life that you might find helpful.

For example, if your agent need to load some resource before it joins the
server, you could do that in the
[`onConnect(Connect)`](https://sgware.github.io/tt-server/edu/uky/cs/nil/tt/Client.html#onConnect(edu.uky.cs.nil.tt.io.Connect))
method which runs after opening the connection but before waiting for a partner.
If you need to clean up that resource before the agent stops, override
[`onDisconnect()`](https://sgware.github.io/tt-server/edu/uky/cs/nil/tt/Client.html#onDisconnect()).
If your agent can play in any story world, you might want to override the
[`onStart(World, Role, State)`](https://sgware.github.io/tt-server/edu/uky/cs/nil/tt/Client.html#onStart(edu.uky.cs.nil.tt.world.World,edu.uky.cs.nil.tt.Role,edu.uky.cs.nil.tt.world.State))
method, which runs as soon as the agent's session starts and tells you all the
details of the story world, your agent's role, and the starting state of the
world.

Got a resource you need to load once and share across all agents? Load it in
your factory's
[`onStart()`](https://sgware.github.io/tt-server/edu/uky/cs/nil/tt/ClientFactory.html#onStart())
method and clean it up in
[`onStop()`](https://sgware.github.io/tt-server/edu/uky/cs/nil/tt/ClientFactory.html#onStop()).

Check out the
[Tandem Tales Server](https://sgware.github.io/tt-server/) library for
documentation on the factory and agent lifecycles.

### Adding and Changing Files

Docker makes it easy to add new files to your agent. If you look at the
[Dockerfile](Dockerfile), you'll see this line:
```
COPY ./root /
```
That line copies all the files and directories in this project's [`root`](root)
folder into the container's root `/` directory. So if you add the file
`root/app/src/Utility.java` to this project, you'll find it at
`/app/src/Utility.py` in the container. If you add
`root/usr/local/bin/script.sh` to this project, you'll find it at
`/usr/local/bin/script.sh` in the container.

You can stop Docker and re-start it every time you make changes to the code, but
that gets tedious. When you launch this container using the Docker Compose
commands shown above, it mounts the [`root/app`](root/app) directory as a
[volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/). That means
everything in that directory is actually a local file on your computer. So you
can edit `RandomAgent.java` while the container is running and the container
sees it instantly. Similarly, any files that get created (like `status.json`
from earlier) are on your computer and will stay there when the container stops.

To make changes to the agent without stopping the container, start the project
like this:
```
docker compose up -d && docker compose attach agent
```
The `-d` flag starts the containers detached. Then the `attach` command attaches
just to the container with your agent in it, and now you're using the same
`bash` shell that is running your Java program.

You can press `ctrl+C` to stop your agent factory. The factory doesn't stop
immediately; it waits for all currently running sessions to end. So if you've
got a session open in a web browser, close that tab so the factory can stop.
Then make some changes to the code using your favorite text editor on your
computer. Now type this to recompile your code and start the factory back up:
```
./compile.sh
./run.dev.sh
```
